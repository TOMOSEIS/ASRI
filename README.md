The seismic data in SU format and shell scripts creat the figures for the Active Seismic Reflection Interferometry method introduced by the paper "Enhanced near-surface imaging using active seismic reflection interferometry by cross-correlation" by Baoping Qiao, Qiao Wang and Yuhang Lei.
The open-source software SeismicUnix, which provides some codes for our shell scipts, can be downloaded by the Wikin at https://wiki.seismic-unix.org.
